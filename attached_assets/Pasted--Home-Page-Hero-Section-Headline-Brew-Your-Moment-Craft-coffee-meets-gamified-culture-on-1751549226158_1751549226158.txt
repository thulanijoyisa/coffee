🌱 About Us


TŌKI is Time. Make it Yours.


We started TŌKI with one goal: to turn your coffee break into something more. Not just caffeine — but connection, clarity, and a little competition too.



Inspired by Japanese minimalism and urban lifestyle culture, TŌKI offers compact, beautifully designed coffee spots that fit perfectly into modern living. Each location is built with purpose, energy, and play in mind.



Our Beliefs:
Quality over compromise.

Design with purpose.

Moments that matter.

Coffee that hits different.
